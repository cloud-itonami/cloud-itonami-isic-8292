  "Phase 0->3 staged rollout for the ISIC-8292 'Packaging activities'
  operations-coordination actor.

    Phase 0  read-only              -- no writes, still governor-gated.
    Phase 1  assisted-logging       -- production-record logging
                                       allowed, every write needs human
                                       approval.
    Phase 2  assisted-coordination  -- adds packaging-line/staffing
                                       scheduling and supply-order
                                       proposals, still approval-gated.
    Phase 3  supervised auto        -- governor-clean, high-confidence
                                       `:log-production-record`/
                                       `:schedule-production-operation`/
                                       `:coordinate-supply-order` may
                                       auto-commit. `:flag-quality-
                                       concern` NEVER auto-commits, at
                                       any phase, and a high-cost
                                       `:coordinate-supply-order` still
                                       escalates even at phase 3 (the
                                       governor's own `high-stakes?`
                                       keeps it out of `:commit`).

  `:flag-quality-concern` is deliberately ABSENT from every phase's
  `:auto` set, including phase 3 -- a permanent structural fact, not a
  rollout milestone still to come. Flagging a package-integrity/
  labeling-accuracy/contamination concern always needs a human to
  actually look at it; this actor never directly finalizes a
  package-integrity-safety clearance or a food/pharma-labeling-
  compliance sign-off itself. `packagingops.governor`'s own
  `always-escalate-ops` enforces the same invariant independently --
  two layers, not one, agree on this."
